<p>A schedule with <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> intervals can have <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> states. A state of a schedule at interval <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is defined by:</p>

<p>- <span class="math inline">\(p^+_t(i)\)</span>, the probability of the total amount of work (<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>) in interval <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, ergo: the work left from the previous state plus all work related to arriving patients.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p^+_t(i)\)</span> is equal to the convolution of the distribution of waiting times of the last patient with the distribution of his service time. The iteration is as follows with K patients scheduled at interval t:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>Step 2: <span class="math inline">\(w_{t1}(i) = w_{t0}(i)*s(i)\)</span> # The next patient has to wait for the previous patient waiting time and service time</p>

<p>This Python class, named <strong><code>Schedule</code></strong>, simulates a scheduling system. Itis be used for analyzing a scheduling system that has time intervals with varying numbers of scheduled patients.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what happens in the class:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Initialization (<code>__init__</code>):</strong> In the initialization function, parameters <strong><code>x</code></strong>, <strong><code>d</code></strong>, <strong><code>s</code></strong> are set which represent the patients scheduled in each interval, the interval length, and the service time distribution, respectively. It also initializes certain elements of the <strong><code>system</code></strong> dictionary such as <strong><code>p_min</code></strong>, <strong><code>p_plus</code></strong>, and <strong><code>w</code></strong> which are used for storing the distributions of work in the system at the start and end of each state and the distributions of waiting times of each patient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>calculate_system_states</code>:</strong> This function is used to calculate the system states. This involves calculation of the amount of work left in the system just before the start of each state (<strong><code>p_min</code></strong>) and just before the end of each state (<strong><code>p_plus</code></strong>), along with the waiting time distributions of patients (<strong><code>w</code></strong>) using convolution. The <strong><code>until</code></strong> parameter can be used to control until which state the system states should be calculated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>impute_compositions</code>:</strong> This function changes the scheduling of patients (represented by the array <strong><code>x</code></strong>) for a certain number of intervals (<strong><code>k</code></strong> intervals starting from interval <strong><code>s</code></strong>). All possible ways of distributing a certain number of tasks (<strong><code>n</code></strong>) over the intervals are generated (<strong><code>compositions</code></strong>), and for each possible distribution, the system states are recalculated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>calculate_wait_times</code>:</strong> This function calculates the expected waiting times for each interval by adding up the expected waiting times of all tasks in the interval.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>visualize_state</code> and <code>visualize_system</code>:</strong> These functions are used to visualize a certain distribution (<strong><code>p_min</code></strong>, <strong><code>p_plus</code></strong>, or <strong><code>w</code></strong>) for a certain state or for all states in a heat map. The visualization is done using Plotly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>__str__</code>:</strong> This function is used to get a string representation of the schedule instance, which shows the values of the <strong><code>p_min</code></strong>, <strong><code>w</code></strong>, <strong><code>p_plus</code></strong>, and <strong><code>ew</code></strong> arrays.</p></li>
