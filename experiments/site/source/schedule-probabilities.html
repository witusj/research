<p>The code above defines a <code>Schedule</code> class that is used to calculate the probability distributions of the amount of work in a system at different states. The class has a constructor that takes three parameters <code>x</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>s</code>, which represent the number of clients scheduled, the interval length, and the service time distribution, respectively.</p>
<p>The constructor initializes the <code>parameters</code> dictionary with the input parameters, and the <code>system</code> dictionary with two NumPy arrays <code>p_min</code> and <code>p_plus</code>. The <code>p_min</code> array represents the probability distribution of the amount of work in the system just before a state starts, and the <code>p_plus</code> array represents the probability distribution of the total amount of work in the system until a state ends. The constructor also initializes the <code>state</code> variable to 0, and sets the first element of <code>p_min</code> in the initial state to 1. Additionally, the constructor initializes an array of arrays for saving waiting times distributions per patient, <code>w</code>, and an array for saving total expected waiting times per state, <code>ew</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Schedule</code> class has two methods <code>calculate_system_states</code> and <code>calculate_wait_times</code>. The <code>calculate_system_states</code> method calculates the probability distributions of the amount of work in the system at different states. The method uses a while loop to iterate over the states, starting from state 1. For each state, the method calculates the probability distribution of the amount of work in the system just before the state starts (<code>p_min</code>), and the probability distribution of the amount of work in the system just after the state ends (<code>p_plus</code>). The method also calculates the waiting time distribution of the patients in the state (<code>w</code>). The <code>calculate_wait_times</code> method calculates the expected waiting time for each time step.</p>
<p>The <code>Schedule</code> class also has a <code>visualize_p_plus</code> method that visualizes the <code>p_plus</code> array in the last calculated state. The method uses the Plotly library to create a scatter plot of the <code>p_plus</code> array.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>Schedule</code> class has a <code>__str__</code> method that returns a string representation of the <code>p_min</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>p_plus</code>, and <code>ew</code> arrays.</p>
<p>To improve the readability of the code, the <code>Schedule</code> class could be refactored to use more descriptive variable names. Additionally, the <code>calculate_system_states</code> method could be split into smaller methods to improve its readability and maintainability. Finally, the <code>visualize_p_plus</code> method could be modified to take a state parameter, allowing the user to visualize the <code>p_plus</code> array for any state.</p>
