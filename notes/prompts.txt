Read the article in great detail. Extract from the article the following information:

    {
        "_comment": "The definition of overbooking is that more than one patients can be booked at the same time slot."
        "Title": "string",
        "Authors": "string",
        "Year": "number",
        "Modeling Approach": {
            "time slot length": ["fixed", "variable", "variable, results from schedule",],
            "schedule format": [
                "number of patients per time slot",
                "appointment time, integer",
                "time interval, continuous"
            ],
            "overbooking allowed": ["yes", "no"],
            "service time": ["exponential distribution", "lognormal distribution", "general distribution"],
            "no-shows assumed": ["yes", "no", "yes, decision-dependent"],
            "emergency patients assumed": ["yes", "no"],
            "punctuality assumed": ["yes", "no"],
            "objective function elements": {
                "waiting time": ["yes", "no"],
                "idle time": ["yes", "no"],
                "overtime": ["yes", "no"]
            }
        },
        "Solution approach": "long text",
        "_log": "long text"
    }

Pay attention to what's mentioned in the _comment item. For each key under Modeling Approach choose a value from the list in the template and return it as a value without the square brackets.

For each key:value item reason why you've decided upon the returned value and DOUBLE-CHECK your answer in the article. Correct your answer when necessary. Save your full reasoning and double-checking as html under the "_log" key in the JSON record.

Combine all information in one JSON list using the given format.
