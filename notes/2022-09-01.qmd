## Lectures Queuing Theory

### Poisson distribution

#### Definition

Assumptions:

-   All numbers of arrival come from the same distribution
-   The numbers of arrival are independent from each other

The arrival rate $\lambda$ is the average number of arrivals per unit of time (eg. patients per hour). The average inter-arrival time is $\frac{1}{\lambda}$.

The service time $\mu$ is the average number of clients a server is able to handle per unit of time if it is always busy (e.g. the number of patients handled by a physician). The average service time equals $\frac{1}{\mu}$.

The offered load, $\rho$, is defined as:

$$
\rho=\frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

The unit of $\rho$ is Erlang and is dimensionless. In a stable queue the rate of clients arriving is lower than the rate at whih clients are served. Otherwise the system is overloaded. So, queue will be stable when:

$$
\rho<1
$$

l = 1
title = "$$P(U_i \geq u)=e^{- \lambda u} \ with \ \lambda = 2 $$"
u = np.arange(7)
P = np.array([math.exp(-1*l*num) for num in u])

Let $U \sim e^ \lambda$ and $S \sim e^ \mu$. Assume that $U$ and $S$ are independent.

Let:

$$
Z=min(U,S)\\, so \ that:
$$

$$
Z=U \ if \ U \leq S
$$
$$
Z=S \ if \ U >U 
$$ Then:

$$
P(Z=U) = P(U \leq S)=\frac {\lambda}{\lambda + \mu} \\
$$
$$
P(Z=S) = P(U > S)=\frac {\mu}{\lambda + \mu}
$$
