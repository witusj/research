        "To explain the relationship between Markov chains and Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) to a student with undergraduate math skills, let's delve into definitions, distinctions, and practical coding examples. Both concepts fall under the umbrella of stochastic processes, which are essentially collections of random variables representing a process observed over time.\n",

        "**Markov Chains:**\n",
        "- A Markov Chain is a stochastic process involving a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.\n",
        "- It is discrete both in time and state. This means the changes (transitions) occur at fixed discrete time points and the state space (set of all possible states) is discrete.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs):**\n",
        "- A CTMC is a type of Markov Chain where the time between transitions is continuous. That is, transitions can occur at any time rather than at fixed discrete times.\n",
        "- The state space can be discrete (e.g., system is either up or down), but the timing of transitions follows a continuous probability distribution, typically an exponential distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Timing of Transitions**: In standard Markov Chains, transitions occur at fixed discrete times (e.g., steps in a board game), whereas in CTMCs, transitions occur continuously over time (e.g., radioactive decay).\n",
        "- **Mathematical Representation**: Markov Chains often use a transition matrix to represent probabilities of moving from one state to another in one time step. CTMCs use a rate matrix (or generator matrix) where off-diagonal elements represent the rate of transitioning from one state to another and diagonal elements are calculated such that each row sums to zero.\n",

        "\n",
        "Fitting phase-type distributions to data involves finding the parameters of a model (like the transition matrix and the initial distribution vector) that best describe observed data. This can be particularly challenging due to the complexity of the calculations involved, but it's a critical skill for applying these distributions in practice.\n",

        "##### **Theoretical Background**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are primarily two methods for fitting data to phase-type distributions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** This method estimates parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data given the model. MLE is powerful but computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or models with many parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Method of Moments (MoM):** This approach involves matching the theoretical moments of the distribution (like mean and variance) to the empirical moments of the data. It's usually simpler and faster than MLE but might be less accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Python Implementation**\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll implement an example of fitting an Erlang distribution (a special case of phase-type distributions with identical phases) using both methods. The Erlang distribution is chosen for its relative simplicity while still capturing the essence of the process.\n",
