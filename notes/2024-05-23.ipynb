        "The provided passage describes the structure and behavior of a tandem queue system and uses specific queuing notation.\n",
        "Let's break down each component to clarify its meaning:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Arrival Process**:\n",
        "    -   **Poisson Process with Rate** $\\lambda$:\n",
        "        -   A Poisson process is a statistical process that models random events occurring independently over time. In this context, jobs arrive at the first station at a rate $\\lambda$. This means that, on average, $\\lambda$ jobs arrive per unit time.\n",
        "    -   **Jobs Lost if No Space**:\n",
        "        -   If a job arrives and there is no available space at station 1, the job is lost. This implies a loss system, where jobs that cannot be immediately processed are discarded rather than queued.\n",
        "2.  **Service Times**:\n",
        "    -   **Exponential Distribution with Rate** $\\mu_i$:\n",
        "        -   Service times at each station $i$ follow an exponential distribution with rate $\\mu_i$. This means that the time to service a job is exponentially distributed, and $\\mu_i$ represents the average service rate of each server at station $i$.\n",
        "3.  **Queuing Notation (**$\\cdot/M/S_i/K_i$):\n",
        "    -   $\\cdot/M/S_i/K_i$: This is a standard notation for describing a specific type of queue:\n",
        "        -   $\\cdot$: The arrival process, which in this case is a Poisson process.\n",
        "        -   **M**: The service times are exponentially distributed (Markovian or memoryless property).\n",
        "        -   $S_i$: The number of servers at station $i$.\n",
        "        -   $K_i$: The total capacity of the system at station $i$, which is the sum of the number of servers $S_i$ and the buffer capacity $C_i$. Thus, $K_i = S_i + C_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "For station $i$, the queue is described as $\\cdot/M/S_i/K_i$, where $K_i = S_i + C_i$.\n",
        "This means: - Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process.\n",
        "- There are $S_i$ servers at the station.\n",
        "- Each server has an exponential service time with rate $\\mu_i$.\n",
        "- The total capacity (number of jobs that can be present, including those in service and in the buffer) is $K_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation with an Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If the first station has: - Arrival rate $\\lambda = 1.5$ jobs per second.\n",
        "- 2 servers ($S_1 = 2$).\n",
        "- Buffer capacity of 3 ($C_1 = 3$).\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, the queue at the first station can be described as: $$\n",
        "\\cdot/M/2/5\n",
        "$$ where $K_1 = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that: - Jobs arrive at an average rate of 1.5 jobs per second.\n",
        "- There are 2 servers, each serving jobs with an exponentially distributed service time.\n",
        "- The station can hold up to 5 jobs in total (2 being serviced and 3 in the buffer).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Blocking**: If the buffer is full (i.e., 3 jobs are waiting and 2 jobs are being serviced), any new arriving jobs will be lost.\n",
        "-   **Service Dynamics**: Jobs are serviced by available servers. If both servers are busy, arriving jobs join the buffer queue until a server becomes free.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python Code Example for Simulation:\n",
