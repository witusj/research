	abstract = {Home health care (HHC) services represent a set of medical services given to patients at their homes. The patients require a set of care that must be coordinated and treated by skilled caregivers corresponding to their needs. This study proposes an HHC routing and assignment approach based on a mixed-integer linear programming model that aims to minimize total route cost. The HHC approach takes into account a set of HHC specific constraints and criteria. Secondly, we propose a new robust counterpart HHC model under uncertainty based on the well-known budgeted uncertainty set. The robust counterpart HHC model deals with travel and service times uncertainty. The computational results compare the deterministic model with its robust counterpart model. The small and medium instances have been solved using TSP benchmarks with specific data concerning HHC problems. The models have been implemented using ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. The computational results of small and medium instances indicated the efficiency of the proposed approach. Robustness analysis of the obtained results was conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation and indicated the price of robustness. The increase of route cost in comparison with the risk of infeasibility shows the importance of the designed robust routes for HHC routing and scheduling problems.},

	abstract = {The increased number of elderly, the prolongation
of life and the urge of costs reduction have changed the way of how the healthcare services are provided. Nowadays, home care service model has rising popularity. Main challenges of this model are the problems of caregivers’ scheduling, their georouting, people management etc. Despite various technological advances, especially in the fields of Internet services, sensors and Internet Of Things, the problem of caregivers’ scheduling is still open and demands for practical
solutions. The process of the scheduling of caregivers to elderly people can be considered as Job Shop Scheduling problem, which is NP-hard for solving. In this paper, we are making analogy of the problem to job shop scheduling problem and we propose agent-bases approach, where corresponding entities are caregivers and elderly people,
and they will be represented as agents. The paper proposes a simulation for the problem based on agents using the Anylogic software.},

	abstract = {Parameter uncertainty is common to several optimization problems, especially in health care where patients’ conditions and service times are highly uncertain. Moreover, in Home Health Care services, where patients are treated over a long time horizon, their clinical condition may change and result in uncertain but also highly time-correlated service times. To include time-correlated uncertain parameters is a difficult task in robust optimization. It has been only marginally addressed, especially in the health care management literature. In this paper, we address the nurse-to-patient assignment problem in Home Health Care services under three types of continuity of care, focusing on uncertain and time-correlated service times. In the literature, this problem has been tackled with stochastic programming, robust optimization, and heuristics; however, service times at different time periods have been treated as independent so far. We propose a robust assignment model that accounts for the time-dependency of patients’ service times, with either constant or increasing overtime cost, and an approach based on the implementor-adversary framework to solve it. Service times are modeled as stochastic parameters and time-correlation is included by limiting the difference in the service time requested by the same patient in two consecutive time periods. The goals are to minimize the cost of staff overtime and the number of reassignments that impair patients’ continuity of care. Results from a relevant realistic case show that the approach does not always converge, but the robust solutions provided, under suitable parameters for the uncertainty description, always outperform the deterministic ones even without full convergence.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Developing and validating a discrete event simulation model that is able to model patients with heart failure managed with usual care or an early warning system (with or without a diagnostic algorithm) and to account for the impact of individual patient characteristics in their health outcomes.
Methods
The model was developed using patient-level data from the Trans-European Network – Home-Care Management System study. It was coded using RStudio Version 1.3.1093 (version 3.6.2.) and validated along the lines of the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models tool. The model includes 20 patient and disease characteristics and generates 8 different outcomes. Model outcomes were generated for the base-case analysis and used in the model validation.
Results
Patients managed with the early warning system, compared with usual care, experienced an average increase of 2.99 outpatient visits and a decrease of 0.02 hospitalizations per year, with a gain of 0.81 life years (0.45 quality-adjusted life years) and increased average total costs of €11 249. Adding a diagnostic algorithm to the early warning system resulted in a 0.92 life year gain (0.57 quality-adjusted life years) and increased average costs of €9680. These patients experienced a decrease of 0.02 outpatient visits and 0.65 hospitalizations per year, while they avoided being hospitalized 0.93 times. The model showed robustness and validity of generated outcomes when comparing them with other models addressing the same problem and with external data.
Conclusions
This study developed and validated a unique patient-level simulation model that can be used for simulating a wide range of outcomes for different patient subgroups and treatment scenarios. It provides useful information for guiding research and for developing new treatment options by showing the hypothetical impact of these interventions on a large number of important heart failure outcomes.},

The intervention of Home Health Care (HHC) has been an asset, however, needs technological innovation for the high level of complexity and requirements. Innovation in the HHC system is crucial since management still occurs manually using classical methods, usually centralized and static. The mapping of real HHC problems, enables an application model of a distributed intelligent system, considering the operational planning needs, promoting a digital and sustainable ecosystem. This work aims to specify a flexible architecture for routing and scheduling tasks in distributed HHC. It considers multi-agent systems technology to guarantee the fast response to condition changes in existing planning, merged with optimization algorithms that allow achieving optimal solutions. Collaboratively, the information digitalization for real-time monitoring will coordinate a socialized solution using different tools and techniques, ensuring robustness and responsiveness in a domain with emerging needs.},

	abstract = {Ensuring sustainable care-giving systems with a focus on human needs and desires is a major challenge. An increasing demand in home health care as well as a limited number of professionals in the labor market have led to a call for efficiency. Thus, managing existing resources has gained relevance. The overall goal is high quality care services, while ensuring economic viability. At the same time, there is a need for modern customer-friendly solutions as well as the consideration of employees’ preferences. To achieve this, adequate methods are needed that take current and future developments into account. Operational management processes in terms of planning and scheduling can be supported by multiagent systems as well as decision support systems using agent-based simulation. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of these solutions in the domain of home health care systems. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review in which 11 relevant approaches were identified. In addition, these publications were analyzed to identify deficiencies and compared to each other. Because none of the approaches offers a sufficient solution, future work will focus on dynamic distributed scheduling for the control of operational processes which increases efficiency and improves the use of limited resources.},

	abstract = {Social science seeks to understand and predict patterns involving human behaviour, many of which are large-scale and complex. But social science explanations or predictions can be difficult to test and refine because of the serious ethical and practical barriers to controlling, manipulating and replicating conditions within experiments. For example, there are many theories behind some of the complex patterns of urban mobility, but when traffic calming measures fail to produce the desired results it can be difficult to identify why or how the situation can be improved.

One possible solution is to run social science experiments in silico, with simulated actors whose features, behaviours and actions are informed by real world data. This allows social scientists to test and refine their understanding of how an observed pattern can be recreated. Computational social science experiments also allow researchers to explore how emergent patterns might change under experimental, or even counter-factual, conditions.

This webinar, organised by the UK Data Service, is the first in a series of three on how to use agent-based models and real world data to run computational social science experiments using the example of urban mobility. Specifically, this webinar:

- introduces the important concepts of emergent patterns, bottom-up processes, and other theoretical ideas underpinning agent-based modelling
- presents several examples of agent-based models
- discusses the pros and cons of agent-based models
- presents several software options for agent-based modelling and where to get more information

Webinars two and three will follow on from this by demonstrating how to open and run agent-based models, how to customise them with GIS data downloaded from the UK Data Service, and how to create a suite of experiments to explore experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {Following on from the webinars introducing ABM and showing how to add real world data, this session demonstrates how social scientists can automate parameter sweeps and experimental conditions within an agent-based model. Further, this webinar will show how to export selected model data to saved files in two different ways. Finally, this webinar will show what exported data looks like and how it might be further manipulated to demonstrate the experimental results.

This free webinar, organised by the UK Data Service, is the third a series of three on how to use agent-based models and real world data to run computational social science experiments using the example of urban mobility. Specifically, this webinar demonstrates:

- how to conduct parameter sweeps for model testing in NetLogo
- how to automate the process of computational experiments (also in NetLogo)
- two different methods of exporting experimental data to saved files for further analysis
- briefly displays what exported experimental data looks like and how it might be analysed to support experimental conclusions},

-- 
 
Docker is an open platform for developers and system administrators to build, ship and run distributed applications. With Docker, IT organizations shrink application delivery from months to minutes, frictionlessly move workloads between data centers and the cloud and can achieve up to 20X greater efficiency in their use of computing resources. Inspired by an active community and by transparent, open source innovation, Docker containers have been downloaded more than 700 million times and Docker is used by millions of developers across thousands of the world’s most innovative organizations, including eBay, Baidu, the BBC, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, ING, Yelp, and Spotify. Docker’s rapid adoption has catalyzed an active ecosystem, resulting in more than 180,000 “Dockerized” applications, over 40 Docker-related startups and integration partnerships with AWS, Cloud Foundry, Google, IBM, Microsoft, OpenStack, Rackspace, Red Hat and VMware.},

For this purpose, more than 150 scientific papers are critically reviewed. The literature and the articles are categorized based on several problem specifications, i.e., the flow of patients, patient preferences, and random arrival time and service. Several methods have been proposed to shorten the patient waiting time resulting in the shortest idle times in healthcare centers. Among existing modeling such as simulation models, mathematical optimization techniques, Markov chain, and artificial intelligence are the most practical approaches to optimizing or improving patient satisfaction in healthcare centers. In this study, various criteria are selected for structuring the recent literature dealing with outpatient scheduling problems at the strategic, tactical, or operational levels. Based on the review papers, some new overviews, problem settings, and hybrid modeling approaches are highlighted.},

The aim of this study was to identify and review operational research approaches to support decision-making in home health care. We identified a set of linked decisions at different planning levels (strategic, tactical, operational) and conducted a systematic review of operational research approaches used to address these decisions. We also sampled OR literature applied to analogous decisions in other settings. The 77 papers selected focused predominantly on solutions for staff-to-patient allocation, visit scheduling and staff routing, few of which were adopted by organisations. Few studies dealt with tactical decisions of team size and composition or strategic decisions of districting, and we found no studies on contract design for commissioning home health care, on staff role definitions or on reassessment of patient need. Integrative work is scarce and the aspects of system performance considered are variable and diverse. For these reasons the literature does not provide guidance for home health care services aspiring to effective and coherent decisions across planning levels. OR approaches from other areas of application provide some insights for future research aimed at addressing this shortfall.},

We prove that this objective function is multimodular, and then use a local search algorithm which in that case is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.

The resulting NN serves as a quick performance evaluation tool and is subsequently used for optimising the tandem-line layout. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the optimal allocation of buﬀer places, and optimising service rates where service rates at machines are associated with costs. Our NN approach is new as we integrate (biased) analytical queuing knowledge into the training data. The set-up and training of the NN, and in particular the integration of analytical results from queuing theory, are discussed in the paper. Our numerical studies corroborate the common belief that analytical results from queuing theory signiﬁcantly improve the prediction power of the ensuing NN. The framework developed in this paper demonstrates how analytical system knowledge can be integrated with data science in performance evaluation and optimisation. Our message here is that even basic NNs combined with formulae available from OR theory, oﬀer invaluable improvements for building metamodellers in simulation optimization.},

	abstract = {We study the design of a healthcare appointment system with a single physician and a group of patients whose service durations are stochastic. The challenge is to find the optimal arrival sequence for a group of mixed patients such that the expected total cost of patient waiting time and physician overtime is minimized. While numerous simulation studies report that sequencing patients by increasing order of variance of service duration (Smallest-Variance-First or SVF rule) performs extremely well in many environments, analytical results on optimal sequencing are known only for two patients. In this paper, we shed light on why it is so difficult to prove the optimality of the SVF rule in general. We first assume that the appointment intervals are fixed according to a given template and analytically investigate the optimality of the SVF rule. In particular, we show that the optimality of the SVF rule depends on two important factors: the number of patients in the system and the shape of service time distributions. The SVF rule is more likely to be optimal if the service time distributions are more positively skewed, but this advantage gradually disappears as the number of patients increases. These results partly explain why the optimality of the SVF rule can only be proved for a small number of patients, and why in practice, the SVF rule is usually observed to be superior, since most empirical distributions of the service durations are positively skewed, like log-normal distributions. The insights obtained from our analytical model apply to more general settings, including the cases where the service durations follow log-normal distributions and the appointment intervals are optimized.},

This approach allows for the consideration of more variables and factors in modeling this system than in prior studies, providing more flexibility in setting policy under various problem settings and environmental factors. Results show that the dome scheduling rule proposed in prior literature is robust, but practitioners could benefit from considering a flatter, “plateau-dome.” The plateau–dome scheduling pattern is shown to be robust over many different performance measures and scenarios.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Appointment scheduling is generally applied in outpatient clinics and other healthcare services. The challenge in scheduling is to find a strategy for dealing with variability and unpredictability in service duration and patient arrivals. The consequences of an ineffective strategy include long waiting times for patients and idle time for the healthcare provider. In turn, these have implications for the perceived quality, cost-efficiency, and capacity of healthcare services. The generation of optimal schedules is a notoriously intractable problem, and earlier attempts at designing effective strategies for appointment scheduling were based on approximation, simulation, or simplification. We propose a novel strategy for scheduling that exploits three tactical ideas to make the problem manageable. We compare the proposed strategy to other approaches, and show that it matches or outperforms competing methods in terms of flexibility, ease of use, and speed. More importantly, it outperforms competing approaches nearly uniformly in approaching the desired balance between waiting and idle times as specified in a chosen objective function. Therefore, the strategy is a good basis for further enrichments.},
