Compare speed local search strategies (with stopping time 1 minute):

-   Strategy 1: Filtered solution space, starting at S = T = 0 (or lowest possible values) and iteratively adding 1 to each side. Then standard local search.

    ```{python}
    #| code-fold: true

    total = 0
    stop = 3
    while total <= stop:
      for s in range(total + 1):
        t = total - s
        print(f"Start = {s}, Tail = {t}")
      total += 1
    ```

-   Strategy 2: Standard local search, with same starting point as in strategy 1.

Q: When we limit $S + T = C$ to what extend does the multimodularity feature hold?
