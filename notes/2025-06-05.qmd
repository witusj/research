Compare speed local search strategies (with stopping time 1 minute):

-   Strategy 1: Filtered solution space, starting at S = T = 0 (or lowest possible values) and iteratively adding 1 to each side. Then standard local search.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true

total = 0
stop = 3
while total <= stop:
  for s in range(total + 1):
    t = total - s
    print(f"Start = {s}, Tail = {t}")
  total += 1
```

-   Strategy 2: Standard local search, with same starting point as in strategy 1.

Q: When we limit $S + T = C$ to what extend does the multimodularity feature hold?

## Suggested Plan of Approach (based on Joost's input)

To address the question of whether the multimodularity (or convexity) feature holds when $S+T=C$:

1.  **Experimental Investigation of Convexity:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct a series of experiments to empirically test for convexity.
    *   **Parameters:** Vary the value of C and other instance parameters.
    *   **Objective:** Observe if the convex relationship (like the light blue line in the current visualizations) persists across different settings.
        *   Consistent observation of convexity across varied parameters strengthens the hypothesis.
        *   Finding even a single counterexample would disprove general convexity under these conditions.
    *   **Note:** Remember that for a given C, you are effectively dealing with a single variable problem (e.g., varying S determines T). This simplifies the experimental setup and analysis.

2.  **Formal Proof Attempts (if experimental evidence is supportive):**
    *   If experiments suggest convexity holds, attempt a formal proof. Two potential avenues:
        *   **Avenue 1 (Direct Proof):** Attempt to prove convexity directly from its mathematical definition, following the approach sketched by Ger.
        *   **Avenue 2 (Adapt Existing Proofs):** Investigate whether the proof arguments from Ger's existing article can be adapted or still apply within this specific "filtered solution space" context (where $S+T=C$).
    *   **Key Insight:** The reduction to a single variable for a fixed C should simplify the proof structure.

3.  **Longer-Term Consideration (For future refinement):**
    *   **Explore Generalization:** Consider a more generalized model by introducing a "curve between the extremes" for patient distribution, rather than just a linear division.
    *   **New Parameter:** The degree or nature of this curve could become a third parameter, refining the S and T parameters. This is for inspiration and potential future enhancements, not an immediate priority.
